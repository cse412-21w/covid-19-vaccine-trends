    <h1 class="display-3">COVID-19 TRENDS</h1>
    <h3 class="subheadline">an exploration of global vaccine distribution</h3>
    <p class="intro-paragraph lead">Countries around the world have started vaccinating against COVID-19, signalling an
        approaching end to the pandemic. However, there is still a lot of ambiguity around timelines on when vaccines
        will be available or when certain groups will be eligible to receive them. Most states and countries are
        currently operating on a very strict rollout plan in structured phases to get the vaccine to vulnerable
        populations first. By analyzing both global and national vaccination data to visualize trends and estimate when
        we can hit certain milestones as well as look at country specific data and compare how vaccine distribution
        plans differ across the globe.

        <h3 class="subheader display-4">A look at the global vaccine rollout</h3>
        <p class="content lead">The first COVID-19 vaccine was administered the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain/go-for-it-says-grandmother-who-got-worlds-first-pfizer-covid-vaccine-in-britain-idUSKBN28I0OQ">first
                week of December</a> in 2020, marking the start of the end of the pandemic. Since then, multiple
            vaccines have been developed and approved for use around the world. Vaccine rollout plans differ greatly, here's
            where countries around the world line up in terms of <em>what percent of their populations have been vaccinated</em> 
        </p>
        <p class="content lead">
            There are currently multiple approved vaccines, some relying on a two-dose strategy while others only require one shot. For the purpose of this next visualization, anyone who has received even one shot (out of a possible two) is counted in the country's vaccination numbers. For example, if a country is labeled at 50%, half of their population has received at least one shot even if that means some residents still need a second. The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress">data</a> reflected below is accurate as of March 3th 2021.

        <p class="content lead">For a more in depth view of the vaccine rollout plan, we can look at the daily
            vaccination rate. In the United States, most states plan on moving in phases to decide who is eligible to
            get the vaccine. In Phase 1, frontline emergency responders and health care workers who were patient facing
            were able to get vaccinated. As states continue to move through phases, more and more people become
            eligible. There are currently three FDA approved vaccines in the United States as of March 15 2021 - the Pfizer vaccine, the Moderna vaccine, and most recently, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. In <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/11/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-all-americans-to-be-eligible-for-vaccinations-by-may-1-puts-the-nation-on-a-path-to-get-closer-to-normal-by-july-4th/">a recent statement</a>, President Biden announced that all Americans will be eligible for vaccinations by May 1.</p>

        <p class="content lead">The United States has had some of the most serious Covid-19 outbreaks from any
            country. In order to combat this, serious effort to administer vaccines has been made. The following gives
            insight on how vaccine distribution looks like in the US by state, per 100,000 people to account for
            different
            populations.</p>


        <p class="content lead">In the following visualizations we can see how many vaccines doses are adminsterred
            on a daily basis in different states. We show 10 largest states in terms of population to analyze the rate 
            at which doses are being administered. It is evident that on a daily basis, these 10 states administer almost
            half of the total doses being administered across the entire country.</p>
